This Arduino-based project integrates RFID authentication with a servo motor and an LCD display. It uses an **MFRC522 RFID module** to scan and validate RFID tags. Upon successful authentication, a **servo motor** is triggered to simulate an access control mechanism. Additionally, **analog sensors** read input values to determine speed limits, which are displayed on a **16x2 LCD screen**. The system provides real-time feedback through the **Serial Monitor** and visual indicators via digital outputs. Ideal for **automated access control** and **speed monitoring applications**, this project enhances security and automation using RFID technology.
